## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

I really enjoyed the SuperLearner Article.  It was interesting to read about the various ways super learners process and digest information.  One item from the list that I already do is read a lot.  Admittedly I wish I could find time to read more and that is a goal of mine going forward.  One item that I could do more of is taking breaks more frequently.  Specifically taking high quality breaks where I step away from my computer to get fresh air as opposed to jumping on social media.  I would add that super learners take time for self-care and exercise frequently which allows their bodies and mind to be in a more energetic state and not lethargic.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

* Number - Includes all numbers, including negative numbers and decimals.  Does not require quotes or commas.
* String - Includes letters and other characters, including numbers.  Single or double quotes will work with strings.
* Boolean - Results in either `true` or `false`.  Very useful with `if` or `else` statements or any function that can have one or two values.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```
console.log("Hello World!");
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

The characters you would use are `//`.  Code comments have many purposes.  Generally code comments are used to either let you and other users
know the purpose of the code you are writing or for you to temporarily prohibit parts of your code from running.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is used to store a value that can then be reused in different areas.  It is helpful to think of variables as a quantity that can change and take on different values, based on user input.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I use twitter frequently.  Twitter uses variables in the following ways:
1. Variable to store your username which would be a string data type.
2. Variable to show how many followers you have which would be a number data type.
3. Variable used to tell me if my password is incorrect or not which would be a boolean data type.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the process of combining or joining variables along with other text to create a sentence.  

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

When I use espn.com the website displays "Hello, aburg15" on the main page which is more than likely displayed using concatenation.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

It appears that using interpolation to inject values into strings is more efficient and less work than concatenation.  Is there a reason
you would use concatenation over interpolation?
