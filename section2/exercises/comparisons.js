//-------------------
// PART 1: Comparing variables
//-------------------

var numberTeachers = 4;
var numberStudents = 20;
var stringTeachers = "4";
var numberDogs = 0;

// EXAMPLE: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?", numberTeachers > numberStudents);
// this should log: "Is numberTeachers greater than numberStudents?" false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers less than numberStudents?", numberTeachers < numberStudents);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers? (use the == operator)
console.log("Is numberTeachers equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers == stringTeachers);
// this should log: true

/*
Note: this is an example of type coercion. Although stringTeachers is a string and numberStudents is an integer,
this statement still evaluated to true. JavaScript forces the stringTeachers into an integer to
perform this evaluation
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers? (use the === operator)
console.log("Is numberTeachers strictly equal to stringTeachers?", numberTeachers === stringTeachers);
// this should log: false

/*
Note: the strictly equal to operator compares the value of the variable in addition to the type of the variable.
since the numberTeachers is an integer value and the stringTeachers is a string value, although they are both equal to 4,
the comparison still evaluates to false.

In JavaScript, it is a best practice to use the strict comparison. It is said that, anytime a developer
thinks they _need_ to use the `==` loose comparison, they are doing something they shouldn't be. To help
you develop good habits that follow best practice, from now on, use the strict comparison.
*/

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?
console.log("Is numberTeachers not equal to numberStudents?", numberTeachers !== numberStudents);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 20?", numberStudents >= 20);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?
console.log("Is numberStudents greater than or equal to 21?", numberStudents >= 21);
// this should log: false

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 20?", numberStudents <= 20);
// this should log: true

// YOU DO: log the result of the comparison: is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?
console.log("Is numberStudents less than or equal to 21?", numberStudents <= 21);
// this should log: true


//-------------------
// PART 2: Articulating what you are doing
//-------------------

// For the following prompts, you will be given a line of code and your task is to type out a Comment,
// in English, explaining what that line of code is doing, including what the comparison will evaluate to.
// Be as technically precise as possible, but don't just copy and paste a definition from the readings.
// Make sure YOU can explain it that way!

console.log(4 < 9);
//YOU DO: Explain.
//Evaluating whether or not 4 is less than 9.  The log result will be true.

var books = 3;
console.log(4 < books);
// YOU DO: Explain.
//Assigning the variable "books" a value of 3.  The log is evaluating whether or not the number 4 is less than
//the value of the books variable.  Since the value of the books variable is 3, which is not greater than 4, the
//resulting log will be false. (Updated typo from "logs" to "log")

var friends = 6;
var siblings = 2;
console.log(friends > siblings);
// YOU DO: Explain.
//Assigning the friends variable a value of 6 and the siblings variable a value of 2.  The log is Evaluating
//if the friends value is greater than the siblings value.  Since 6 is greater than 2, the resulting log will be true.

var attendees = 9;
var meals = 8;
console.log(attendees !== meals);
// YOU DO: Explain.
//Assigning the attendees variable a value of 9 and the meals variable a value of 8.  The log is Evaluating
//if the attendees value does not equal the meals value.  Since 9 does not equal 8, the resulting log is true.

//-------------------
// PART 3: Logical Operators
//-------------------

var isHungry = true;
var finishedHomework = false;

// EXAMPLE:
// Determine if the user is hungry and has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry && finishedHomework);
// Determine if the user is hungry or has completed their homework
console.log(isHungry || finishedHomework);

var lovesToPlay = true;
var lovesDogPark = false;
var lovesTreats = true;
var age = 1;

// YOU DO:
// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves treats
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesTreats);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay && lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play or loves the dog park
console.log(lovesToPlay || lovesDogPark);

// Determine if the dog loves to play and is a puppy
console.log(lovesToPlay && age <= 1);

// What did your final line of code evaluate to? Why do you think that is? Explain.
// ANSWER:
// The final line of code evaluated to true.  This is becuase the lovesToPlay variable
// is equal to true and the age <= 1 parameter I added to the log is also equal to true.

// FINAL CHECK
//-------------------

// Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the console
// as you would expect?
