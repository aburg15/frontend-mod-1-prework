## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

The blog posts related to asking questions were very informative.  I realized that I fall into the group of people who felt that asking questions was a sign
of weakness, not strength.  The blog post made me realize that I have never looked at someone else's question as dumb, so why should I feel that way about
my own questions.  In the past I have tended to wait too long to ask questions, or not ask them at all.  I will improve on this going forward and ask questions
more frequently.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It was uncomfortable to have the "training wheels" taken off but I strongly feel that it enhanced my learning process.  By taking the time to search and find the answers I needed
as opposed to just having them handed to me really reinforced the concepts we are covering.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement assists with the decision making process by evaluating a block of code and returning a statement based on various conditions.  Conditional statements
include if, else and else if statements.  An example of a daily life conditional is if my dog is hungry, she will stand by her food bowl.  An example of a web application
using conditional statements could be an alcohol manufacturer's website prompting an alert to the user that they are not 21 or older.  If the date entered by the user indicates
their age is less than 21, then an alert could pop up indicating they cannot enter the website.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You would add multiple conditions to an `if` statement by using `else if`.  A program reads an `else if` statement by evaluating each section to determine if the statement is true.
If the statement is true, the result is logged and the rest of the section is not evaluated.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

You could use what are known as logical operators.  The `&&` logical operator will check that two conditions are met and the `||` logical operator will check that 1 of 2 conditions are met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

No questions are noted at this time.  I simply need to practice through the exercises more to become more proficient and comfortable with conditional statements in general.
