## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

Two points from the Growth Mindset article that resonated with me was:

  1. Understanding that mistakes are essential in coding
  1. Not being afraid to seek help

Both of these points may come across as signs of weakness but both are inevitable, especially in a field such as software development.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I demonstrate a growth mindset by admitting my mistakes and attempting to to learn from them.  I need to do a better job of seeking out challenges and taking them head on.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I frequently use Gmail.  In example of an array that Gmail uses is by storing each message in the inbox/outbox in an array.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array methods are available to quickly manipulate or edit an existing array.  You can add/remove/replace, etc. existing arrays by using array methods.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

Loops are used to perform a repeated task based on a condition until that loop returns a false value, at which point the loop ends.  You would use a loop in conjunction with an array if you were dealing with a list of items that needed to be analyzed.   

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop is used to continuously evaluate a list or set of data, based on a condition, until that list does not meeting the conditions of the loop.  For example, we could use a loop to analyze a list of numbers (1 through 5) and if the list exceeds 5, the loop would end.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

What are some real-world examples of companies using arrays and loops together?
