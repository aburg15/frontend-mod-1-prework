## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

  Using the Pomodoro technique this week without a doubt helped me to focus for longer periods of time and my work was much more efficient.
  The 5 minute breaks helped me reset and often times after the break I was able to solve the issue that I could not previously solve.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

  For me it depended on the day and how focused/motivated I was that day.  As I work through more difficult HW assignments or session exercises,
  I would require more frequent breaks so that I could reset.  I would find myself less distracted when working through coding assignments vs. non-coding
  assignments where I would often check social media, etc.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

  An Object is a list of items (similar to an array) consisting of key/value pairs.  The key value/pairs included in an object can be more easily changed
  than an array listing and the key value/pairs can contain 'complex data'.  

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - Array: all of the students names would be a string data type which is easily stored and used in an array.

  * List of states and their capitals
    - Object: Since we are listing out both states and their capitals, the key value pairing from objects would work well.

  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - Array: all of the items to pack would be a string data type which is easily stored and used in an array.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - Array: all of the Instagram accounts would be a string data type which is easily stored and used in an array.

  * List of student names and their cohort
    - Object: Since we are listing out both students and their cohort, the key value pairing used in objects would work here.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - Object: Ingredients would be our key and the quantity would be our value.

  * All my favorite restaurants
    - Array: all of the restaurants would be a string data type which is easily stored and used in an array.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
  If I was using Yelp! to research a restaurant I wanted to eat at I would potentially see the following object model:
    ```javascript
    var restaurant = {
      name: 'Texas Roadhouse',
      rating: 4.2,
      type: 'American',
      phone: '323-4412'
      customerReviews: ['great service', 'great food', 'great steaks']
    }

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
  None at this time.
